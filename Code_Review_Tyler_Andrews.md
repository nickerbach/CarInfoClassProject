Project name: Every Auto
Programmers: Corey Lowe
Code Reviewer: Tyler Andrews

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for thei submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:
  The App looks good, but I think it could use better documentation. Your code doesn't have many comments. (Especially MakeListActivity, ModelListActivity, etc.)
  Also, I think an info/about/help screen would be helpful to show the user what the app does.
  Some makes/models caused an error when clicking load info, and very rarely the entire app would crash.
  Overall, great work so far.

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
-Add more code comments
-Help/info screen
-Fix crashes
