Code Reviewer: __Vince Carpino__

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of **4** based on the following criteria:

1 - The documentation is insufficient to enable me to compile the project, or at least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

2 - The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3 - The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4 - The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for the submission or is insufficiently documented.<br>Specifically: _Really cool idea for an app. The features you have implemented so far seem to work how you want them. I noticed that when selecting a make/model in the scroll wheel, it actually "chooses" one above or below the centered one. Other than that, it would crash at certain points but you had pointed this out in the README._

5 - The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented
